***How are graceful degradation and service workers related?***
<br>
`Graceful degradation and service workers are related because service workers are used to effectively implement graceful degradation. If the user's browser does not support service workers, then the application will gracefully degrade. Otherwise, if the user's browser does support service workers, the user's application can be enhanced with things such as offline availability.`
